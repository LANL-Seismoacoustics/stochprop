The methods in *stochprop* were developed by infrasound SMEs at Los Alamos National Laboratory and University of Mississippi National Center for Physical Acoustics as documented in Blom et al. (2023).  The Python implementation of the methods has been written and is maintained by Philip Blom at LANL.  For any questions on the methods, see the GJI publication and for questions or issues with the implementation and features of the software contact:

The Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses available in *stochprop* are part of ongoing joint research between infrasound scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the University of Mississippi's National Center for Physical Acoustics (NCPA).  The methods are summarized in the below manuscript:

Stochastic, propagation-based models for infrasonic signal analysis were initially introduced in analysis of the Bayesian Infrasonic Source Localization (BISL) and Spectral Yield Estimation (SpYE) framworks so that usage of path geometry and transmission loss models should be cited using:

Gravity wave perturbation methods are implemented here as a prototype feature and leverage work by Drob et al. (2013) and Lalande & Waxler (2016) as well as supporting work referenced in those manuscripts:
