The Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses available in :code:`stochprop` are part of ongoing joint research between infrasound scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the University of Mississippi's National Center for Physical Acoustics (NCPA) and will be summarizing in an upcoming publication:

* Waxler, R., Blom, P., & Frazier, W. G., On the generation of statistical models for infrasound propagation from statistical models for the atmosphere: identifying seasonal and regional trends.  *Geophysical Journal International*, In Preparation

Stochastic, propagation-based models for infrasonic signal analysis were initially introduced in analysis of the Bayesian Infrasonic Source Localization (BISL) and Spectral Yield Estimation (SpYE) framworks so that usage of path geometry and transmission loss models should be cited using:
