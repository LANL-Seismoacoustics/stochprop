The Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses available in :code:`stochprop` are part of ongoing joint research between infrasound scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the University of Mississippi's National Center for Physical Acoustics (NCPA) and will be summarizing in an upcoming publication:

* Waxler, R., Blom, P., & Frazier, W. G. (2020) Spatial and seasonal trends in atmospheric structure and predicted infrasonic propagation for the continental US.  *Geophysical Journal International*, In Preparation

Stochastic, propagation-based models for infrasonic signal analysis were initially introduced in analysis of the Bayesian Infrasonic Source Localization (BISL) and Spectral Yield Estimation (SpYE) framworks so that usage of path geometry and transmission loss models should be cited using:

* Blom, P. S., Marcillo, O., & Arrowsmith, S. J. (2015). Improved Bayesian infrasonic source localization for regional infrasound. *Geophysical Journal International*, 203(3), 1682-1693.

* Blom, P. S., Dannemann, F. K., & Marcillo, O. E. (2018). Bayesian characterization of explosive sources using infrasonic signals. *Geophysical Journal International*, 215(1), 240-251.

See the documentation for the supporting packages (InfraGA/GeoAc, NCPAprop, InfraPy) for guidance on citing usage of those methods.
