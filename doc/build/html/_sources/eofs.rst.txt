Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis
=======================================

* Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are a mathematical tool useful for characterizing a suite of vectors or functions via construction of basis vectors or functions.
* Consider :math:`N` fields, :math:`a_n (\vec{z})`, sampled at :math:`M` points, :math:`z_m` that define a matrix,

.. math::
	A \left( \vec{z} \right) = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    a_1 \left( z_1 \right) & a_2 \left( z_1 \right) 	& \cdots 	& a_N \left( z_1 \right) \\
    a_1 \left( z_2 \right) & a_2 \left( z_2 \right) 	& \cdots 	& a_N \left( z_2 \right) \\
    \vdots 				& \vdots					& \ddots	& \vdots 	 \\
    a_1 \left( z_M \right) & a_2 \left( z_M \right)	& \cdots 	& a_N \left( z_M \right)
    \end{pmatrix}
    
* Analysis of this :math:`N \times M` matrix to compute EOFs entails first extracting the mean set of values and then applying a singular value decomposition (SVD) to define singular values and orthogonal functions,

.. math::
    A \left( \vec{z} \right) 
    \, \xrightarrow{\text{SVD}} \, 
    \bar{a} \left( z_m \right), \mathcal{S}_n^{(a)}, \mathcal{E}_n^{(A)} \left( z_m \right)

* The resulting EOF information can be used to reproduce any other other field sampled on the same set of points,

.. math::
	\hat{b} \left( z_m \right) = \bar{a} \left( z_m \right) + \sum_n{ \mathcal{C}_n^{(b)} \mathcal{E}_n^{(A)} \left( z_m \right)},
	
   	\mathcal{C}_n^{(b)} = \sum_m{\mathcal{E}_n^{(A)} \left( z_m \right) \left( b \left( z_m \right) - \bar{a} \left( z_m \right) \right)},

* Note that the coefficients, :math:`\mathcal{C}_n^{(b)}`, are defined by the projection of the new function onto each EOF (accounting for the mean, :math:`\bar{a}`)

* Consider a second matrix, :math:`B\left( \vec{z} \right)` defined by a set of :math:`K` fields, :math:`b_k \left( \vec{z} \right)`.  Each of these columns produces a set of coefficients that can be used to define a distribution via a kernel density estimate (KDE),

.. math::
    \left\{ \mathcal{C}_n^{(b_1)},  \mathcal{C}_n^{(b_2)}, \ldots, \mathcal{C}_n^{(b_K)} \right\}
	\, \xrightarrow{\text{KDE}} \,
	\mathcal{P}_n^{(B)} \left( \mathcal{C} \right).

* Comparison of the distributions for various matrices, :math:`B_1, B_2, B_3, \ldots`, allows one to define the relative similarity between differen sets by computing the overlap and weighting each term by the EOF singular values,

.. math::
	 \Gamma_{j,k}  =  \sum_n{ \mathcal{S}_n^{(\text{all})} \int{\mathcal{P}_n^{(B_j)} \left( \mathcal{C} \right) \mathcal{P}_n^{(B_k)} \left( \mathcal{C} \right) d \mathcal{C} }}

* In the case of EOF analysis for atmospheric seasonality and variability, each :math:`a_m(\vec{z})` is an atmospheric specification sampled at a set of altitudes, :math:`\vec{z}`, and the set of atmospheric states in :math:`A` includes all possible states for the entire year (and potentially multiple years).  The sets of atmospheres in each matrix, :math:`B_j`, is a subset of :math:`A` corresponding to a specific month or other interval.  The coefficient overlap can be computed for all combinations to identify seasonality and determine the grouping of intervals for which propagation effects will be similar.


************************
EOF methods in stochprop
************************
* Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis methods can be accessed by importing :code:`stochprop.eofs`
* Although analysis can be completed using any set of user defined paths, it is recommended to build a set of directories to hold the eof results, coefficient analyses, and samples produced from seasonal analysis.  This pre-analysis set up can be completed manually or by running:


.. code-block:: python

	import os
	import subprocess
	import numpy as np

	from stochprop import eofs

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		eof_dirs = ["eofs", "coeffs", "samples"]
		season_labels = ["winter", "spring", "summer", "fall"]

		for dir in eof_dirs:
			if not os.path.isdir(dir):
				subprocess.call("mkdir " + dir, shell=True)

		for season in season_labels:
			if not os.path.isdir("samples/" + season):
				subprocess.call("mkdir samples/" + season, shell=True)

------------------------------
Load Atmosphere Specifications
------------------------------

* Atmospheric specifications are available through a number of repositories including the Ground-to-Space (G2S) system, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and other sources
* A convenient source for G2S specifications is the University of Mississippi's National Center for Physical Acoustics (NCPA) G2S server at http://g2s.ncpa.olemiss.edu
* The current implementation of EOF methods in stochprop assumes the ingested specifications are formatted such that the columns contain altitude, temperature, zonal winds, meridional winds, density, pressure (that is, :code:`zTuvdp` in the infraGA/GeoAc profile options), which is the default output format of the G2S server at NCPA.  Note: a script is included in the infraGA/GeoAc methods to extract profiles in this format from ECMWF netCDF files.
* The atmosphere matrix, :math:`A(\vec{z})` can be constructed using :code:`stochprop.eofs.build_atmo_matrix` which accepts the path where specifications are located and a pattern to identify which files to ingest.

	- For seasonal analysis, it is useful to initially separate atmospheric specifications by month.  Assuming subdirectories labeled "01", "02", "03", ... "12" contain profiles for January through December (see the subdirectories in the examples directory of the package), atmospheres can be ingested and combined using :code:`numpy.vstack`
	- The optional argument, ref_alts, should be used to ensure a common vertical sampling if multiple directories are being ingested in this manner.

	.. code-block:: python
	
		A, z0 = eofs.build_atmo_matrix("profs/01/", "g2stxt_*")
		for n in range(2, 13):
			A_temp, _ = eofs.build_atmo_matrix("profs/{:02d}/".format(n), "g2stxt_*", ref_alts=z0)
			A = np.vstack((A, A_temp))

	- Alternately, if all profiles are contained within a common directory, ingestion can be completed using a single call,

	.. code-block:: python

		A, z0 = eofs.build_atmo_matrix("profs/", "g2stxt_*")

--------------
Computing EOFs
--------------

* Once the atmosphere matrix, :math:`A(\vec{z})` has been ingested, EOF analysis can be completed using:

.. code-block:: python

	eofs.compute_eofs(A, z0, "eofs/examples")

* The analysis results are written into files with prefix specified in the function call ("eofs/examples" in this case).  The contents of the files are summarized is the below table.

+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| EOF Output File                      | Description                                                                               |

+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| eofs/example-adiabatic_snd_spd.eofs  | EOFs for the adiabatic sound speed, :math:`c_\text{ad} = \sqrt{ \gamma \frac{p}{\rho}}`   |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| eofs/example-ideal_gas_snd_spd.eofs  | EOFs for the ideal gas sound speed, :math:`c_\text{ad} = \sqrt{ \gamma R T}`              |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| eofs/example-merid_winds.eofs        | EOFs for the meridional (north/south) winds                                               |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| eofs/example-zonal_winds.eofs        | EOFs for the zonal (east/west) winds                                                      |
+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

* The EOF file formats is such that the first column contains the altitude points, :math:`\vec{z}`, and each subsequent column contains the :math:`n^{th}` EOF, :math:`\mathcal{E}_n^{(A)} \left( \vec{z} \right)`

* As discussed in Waxler et al. (2020), the EOFs are computed using stacked wind and sound speed values to conserve coupling between the different atmospheric parameters and maintain consistent units (velocity) in the EOF coefficients
    
* The resulting EOFs can be used for a number of analyses including atmospheric updating, seasonal studies, perturbation analysis, and similar analyses

----------------------------------------------
Compute Coefficients and Determine Seasonality
----------------------------------------------
* Using the EOFs for the entire calendar year, coefficient sets can be defined for individual months (or other sub-intervals) using the :code:`stochprop.eofs.compute_coeffs` function.

* For identification of seasonality by month, the coefficient sets are first computed for each individual month using:

.. code-block:: python

    coeffs = [0] * 12
    for m in range(1, 13):
        Am, zm = eofs.build_atmo_matrix("profs/{:02d}/".format(m), g2stxt_*")
        coeffs[m - 1] = eofs.compute_coeffs(Am, zm, "eofs/example", "coeffs/example_{:02d}".format(m), eof_cnt=eof_cnt)

* The resulting coefficient sets are analyzed using :code:`stochprop.eofs.compute_overlap` to identify how similar various month pairs are:

.. code-block:: python

    overlap = eofs.compute_overlap(coeffs, eof_cnt=eof_cnt)    
    eofs.compute_seasonality("coeffs/example-overlap.npy", "eofs/example", "coeffs/example")

* The output of this analysis is a dendrogram identifying those months that are most similar.  In the below result, May - August is identified as a consistent "summer" season, October - March as "winter", and September and April as "spring/fall" transition between the two dominant seasons 

.. figure:: _static/_images/example_seasonality.png
    :width: 400px
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text
    :figclass: align-center
    
    Clustering analysis on coefficient overlap is used to identify which months share common atmospheric structure

----------------------

* A command line interface (CLI) for the EOF methods is also included and can be utilized more easily.  Usage info for the EOF construction methods can be displayed by running :code:`stochprop build-eofs --help`:
